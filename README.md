# Streetz of Los Santos Roleplay
The Streetz of Los Santosâ„¢ is the first and only San Andreas: Multi-Player roleplay server based on the story line and concept of the original game. Delivering fun, doubtlessly. With our lively community, 10 years of success and gangster roleplay that you've seen nowhere else, you would surely be amazed and love having that 90's feel.
